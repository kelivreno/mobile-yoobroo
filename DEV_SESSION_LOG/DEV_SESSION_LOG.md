# Development Session Log

## Date: 2024-05-12

### Project Cleanup & Setup
- Removed redundant files and folders from previous web and Vite projects.
- Consolidated the mobile app into the `yoobroo-mobile/` directory.
- Moved assets (logo, icons) from `public/` to `yoobroo-mobile/assets/` for React Native compatibility.
- Created a root `package.json` with scripts to run the Expo app from the project root.

### Expo & Dependency Management
- Ensured Expo SDK and dependencies are up to date.
- Resolved peer dependency issues using `--legacy-peer-deps` where necessary.
- Installed and configured `lucide-react-native` for vector icons.
- Installed `react-native-svg` as a required peer dependency for icon rendering.

### UI/UX Implementation
- Recreated the login and sign up screens to closely match the web app's design:
  - Centered logo at the top.
  - Used Lucide icons for name, email, password, and password visibility toggle.
  - Styled input fields, buttons, and links to match the web color scheme (`#F45B37` primary, light gray borders, etc).
  - Added a "Forgot your password?" link for login and a terms/privacy disclaimer for sign up.
  - Implemented toggle between sign in and sign up modes in a single screen.

### Troubleshooting & Fixes
- Fixed missing module errors for images and icons by moving files to the correct directory.
- Addressed missing peer dependencies and React version warnings.
- Removed unnecessary polyfills and cleaned up imports.

### Next Steps
- Implement real authentication logic (currently, login/sign up is UI only).
- Further refine navigation and split sign in/sign up into separate screens if desired.
- Add more features or polish as needed.
